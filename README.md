# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch is a coding project that takes a grid of elements and
colors them as the mouse hovers over each element, similar to how
the toy etch-a-sketch works.

This webpage uses HTML to give basic structure to the page, CSS to
style elements, and javascript to make the game work.
